Thank you for downloading my work.
Please take a moment to review the following before using it.

----------------------------------------------------------------
■　Summary
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is a tool that allows you to batch replace the name fields in PMX models.
It is primarily intended for converting Chinese model names into Japanese, but there are no restrictions on loading models, so it can also be used for renaming existing models.

- Basically, you can simply run the exe as is.
- File history can be copied by placing "user_config.json" in the same directory as the exe.
- Name Replacement
    - Specify the PMX model and CSV dictionary to replace names that match the specified strings.
    - The output path is also replaced according to the dictionary, and it outputs everything, including textures.
    - When you load the model and dictionary, the replacement results are displayed in the table field.
    - The background color of the name fields that are scheduled to be replaced is changed.
- CSV Output
    - Outputs CSV data, which serves as the source data for the dictionary.
    - When you load the PMX model, the list of names is displayed in the table field.
    - If there are characters that cannot be recognized by Shift-JIS (such as Simplified Chinese characters), a check is added when initially displayed.
    - You can also include any other name fields you want to convert by checking them.

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the video.
